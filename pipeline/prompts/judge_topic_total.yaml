  Instructions:
    Ten-Point Scale
    1-2 Points:
      • Extremely narrow scope (only mainstream products; no other lines/scenarios/users).
      • Very shallow depth (surface-level brand impressions; no features/experiences/details).
      • No actionable insights for understanding customers or improving products.
 
    3-4 Points:
      • Limited scope (some product/scenario categories but fragmented/incomplete).
      • Limited depth (basic usage covered; no specifics, pain points, or emotional experiences).
      • Minimal reference value; little help for understanding needs or guiding development.

    5-6 Points:
      • Moderate scope (covers products, scenarios, functions; reasonable range, no major gaps).
      • Moderate depth (explores functions/applications but rarely emotions or deep experiences).
      • Average value; some useful info but no critical/transformative perspectives.

    7-8 Points:
      • Broad scope (comprehensive coverage of products, scenarios, functions, experiences; few gaps).
      • In-depth focus (details on usage, features, and nuanced experiences like satisfaction/challenges).
      • High value for most questions; actionable insights for refining products/experiences/services.

    9-10 Points:
      • Extremely broad scope (includes products, scenarios, functions, experiences, and innovation trends).
      • Exceptionally deep (granular details, brand comparisons, and potential upgrade/differentiation directions).
      • Exceptional value for all questions; critical insights for understanding expectations, competitiveness, and long-term growth.

  Think step by step and be very conservative when scoring.

    You can conduct a thorough analysis and elaboration, but your output must explicitly include content in the following form: 
    ***Final Score: X.***   X is a integer. The full-stop at the end should not be deleted.
