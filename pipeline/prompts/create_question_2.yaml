template: |
  Instructions:
  1. I will upload an array of length {{num_questions}}. Each element contains a summary sentence of {{product_series}}. You need to draft a factual question based on the content of the summary sentence. The question should be logically coherent and closely related to the sentence. It should also aim to explore users’ attitudes and perceptions toward the product. Repeat this process until each array element has a corresponding question.

  2. Strictly return the results according to the following template:
     {{
       "Question X": {{
         "question": "<one concise sentence>",
         "options": [
           "A. <choice 1>",
           "B. <choice 2>",
           "C. <choice 3>",
           "D. <choice 4>"
         ],
         "answer": "<Letter>. <exact correct option text>"
       }},
       ...
     }}
     Formatting rules  
       • Exactly four labelled options (A-D).  
       • The "answer" field must contain a brief summary of users' discussions regarding the question.

          "B. Could be improved to be more competitive.",
          "C. Adequate but not leading the charge.",
          "D. Lacks competitiveness entirely."
        ],
        "answer": "B. Could be improved to be more competitive."
