  ================================================================
  INSTRUCTIONS
  ================================================================

  1. Draft 25 factual questions that probe product users' attitudes and thoughts towards the product.
  2. The questions you propose should take into account both depth and breadth.

    Depth means that the content of each of your question should extend to the higher levels among the 6 categories:
    We categorize the content involved in each question into 6 progressive levels, which are as follows:
    ① Model: The specific product model under discussion, such as Apple Vision Pro2 (from Apple's Vision Pro series); Windows 11 (from Microsoft's Windows series).
    ② Usage Scenario: The specific usage scenario being discussed.
    ③ Aspect: A precise summary of the product aspect under discussion.
    ④ Feeling: An adjective describing the discussed function, which reflects the product's user experience.
    ⑤ Comparison: Other models or brands against which the discussed feature is compared; these models may be from other brands, such as BYD Qin (compared with Tesla Model Y); or MLB (compared with New Balance).
    ⑥ Tendency: What kind of advice or speculation does the discussion put forward regarding {{brand}}'s future direction?

    Breadth means that the content of your questions should cover more categories of low-level content (① Model, ② Usage Scenario) and avoid over-concentrating on only a few specific models or scenarios. Specifically, you will receive higher rewards when you cover various relevant models of {{brand}} {{product_series}} series products.

  3.The question sentences and at least one option in the questions must be completely derived from the real discussions among users. 
  4. The target group of the questionnaire is product users, specifically owners of {{brand}} {{product_series}} series products. Please appropriately adjust the wording of the questions to align with this audience. Questions that require product data analysis to answer should not be posed to product users.
  5. Return the questions in the following *strict* JSON schema:
      {
        "Question X": {
          "question": "<one concise sentence>",
          "options": [
            "A. <choice 1>",
            "B. <choice 2>",
            "C. <choice 3>",
            "D. <choice 4>"
          ],
          "answer": "<Letter>. <Summary derived from the real disucussion among users>"
        },
        ...
      }
    Formatting rules:
      • Exactly four labelled options (A-D).  
      • The "answer" field must contain a brief summary of users' discussions regarding the question.  
  7. Produce **only** the final JSON object with 25 entries—no commentary, headers, or extra lines.
     Do not add any json markers before or after your output json str.
