  Instructions:
    Ten-Point Scale

      • No actionable insights for understanding customers or improving products.
 
    3-4 Points:
      • Limited depth (basic usage covered; no specifics, pain points, or emotional experiences).
      • Minimal reference value; little help for understanding needs or guiding development.

    5-6 Points:
      • Moderate depth (explores functions/applications but rarely emotions or deep experiences).
      • Average value; some useful info but no critical/transformative perspectives.

    7-8 Points:
      • In-depth focus (details on usage, features, and nuanced experiences like satisfaction/challenges).
      • High value for most questions; actionable insights for refining products/experiences/services.

    9-10 Points:
      • Exceptionally deep (granular details, brand comparisons, and potential upgrade/differentiation directions).
      • Exceptional value for all questions; critical insights for understanding expectations, competitiveness, and long-term growth.

  Think step by step and be very conservative when scoring.
